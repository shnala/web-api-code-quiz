# web-api-code-quiz

## Description
This is a simple quiz app developed for web clients using JavaScript. It tests your knowledge of Web API's with five questions, and the faster you can answer them, the higher your score. Your score will be saved so you can run the quiz again and try to score even higher. The quiz is timed and the score is based on the time remaining when you answer the last question. I wanted to develop something that appeared simple but tested my understanding of JavaScript behind the scenes. It's taught me a lot about things like event listeners, iterations, how to define functions, etc., but I still have a lot to learn. The app is in need of refactoring but the core functions are available.

## Installation
